### I can guide you through creating your own microservices for the project! Here's a step-by-step process to create a simple microservices architecture using **Python (Flask)**. This example will walk you through creating three basic microservices: **User Service**, **Product Service**, and **Order Service**.

### **Step 1: Setting Up the Environment**

1. **Install Python** if you don't already have it.
2. **Install Flask**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

### **Step 2: Create the Microservices**

#### 1. **User Service (Python + Flask)**

- Create a directory for your project:
  ```bash
  mkdir user-service
  cd user-service

This service will run on port `5000`, exposing the following endpoints:
- **GET /users**: Retrieves all users.
- **GET /users/<id>**: Retrieves a single user by ID.
- **POST /users**: Creates a new user.

#### 2. **Product Service (Python + Flask)**

- Create another directory for the product service:
  ```bash
  mkdir ../product-service
  cd ../product-service

This service will run on port `5001`, exposing the following endpoints:
- **GET /products**: Retrieves all products.
- **GET /products/<id>**: Retrieves a single product by ID.
- **POST /products**: Creates a new product.

#### 3. **Order Service (Python + Flask)**

- Create a directory for the order service:
  ```bash
  mkdir ../order-service
  cd ../order-service
run on port `5002`, exposing the following endpoints:
- **GET /orders**: Retrieves all orders.
- **GET /orders/<id>**: Retrieves a single order by ID.
- **POST /orders**: Creates a new order.

### **Step 3: Orchestrate the Microservices in Docker**

You can containerize these microservices with Docker and orchestrate them on **AWS EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service).

1. **Create a Dockerfile** for each service.

Example Dockerfile for the **User Service** (`user-service/Dockerfile`):
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

RUN pip install flask

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

2. **Build and Run the Docker Images**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t user-service .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 user-service
   ```

Repeat this process for the Product and Order services.

### **Step 4: Deploy to AWS EKS**

You can now deploy these services on **AWS EKS** by creating Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for the **Deployments** and **Services**.

### **Step 5: CI/CD and Monitoring Setup**

- Use **AWS CodePipeline** to automate the build and deployment of these services.
- Use **AWS CloudWatch** to monitor the performance of the services, and set up **Grafana** with **Prometheus** for custom dashboards.
